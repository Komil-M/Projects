# Projects
Here are my projects and my small codes that I do through my days.

Naruto.py : basically my personal project I did when I was bored during the summer, I was watching this show and I wanted to automate it so I don't have to keep using my mouse to go over things everytime, this whole bot automates it for me. It opens the show, opens the episode on where I left of by opening the file that contains the number and updates it when I'm done with the episode. Pretty basic and fun thing.
