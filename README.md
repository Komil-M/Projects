# Projects
Here are my projects and my small codes that I do through my days.
The reason I don't add my projects is because I work on them on my computer and keep them on my PC till I finish, none finished work isn't coming out anytime soon, anyways I'll be releasing projects in batches, if I finish 5 or more codes I shall put them all together, till then we shall wait.

Naruto.py : basically my personal project I did when I was bored during the summer, I was watching this show and I wanted to automate it so I don't have to keep using my mouse to go over things everytime, this whole bot automates it for me. It opens the show, opens the episode on where I left of by opening the file that contains the number and updates it when I'm done with the episode. Pretty basic and fun thing.
